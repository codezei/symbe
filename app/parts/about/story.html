                        The original idea for Symbe was inspired by our experiences at Tictrac, a pioneer in B2B Digital Health and Wellness. Our greatest challenge was that our product, perceived as a 'nice-to-have', often took a backseat to other initiatives. Our first major deal took over 18 months to close.  I vividly recall our champion sat me down and said, “Look, I get the benefit of your solution, but help me build a business case to demonstrate the value to us and to help me sell this internally”.  We built the business case together, won the deal and they were our longest standing client.

                        Most importantly, we realised two vital insights: (1) the importance of using business cases to align with our buyer, and (2) the power of providing our Champion with a tool that helps them sell our solution to their stakeholders.

                        We started creating business cases for every deal, building our key metrics and most importantly engaging with our buyers on them. But the process was clunky and very time-consuming. Business cases required a lot of work to formulate on Excel, adapt for every sales opportunity and then transfer them into some form of compelling narrative -exec summary, proposal, etc.- for different internal stakeholders.  There had to be a better way!
